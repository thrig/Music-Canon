See the git repository. Otherwise, of note:

 * 2.00 boy howdy breaking interface changes in transition to Moo, stateless
   design (and therefore fewer troublesome reset_* methods), a modal_hook to
   handle modal_map exceptions, and modal_map improvements as transposition was
   not fully aware of all the gears necessary for when the input or output
   tonics are not modulus zero. Etc.

   set_scale_intervals( 'input'   ->  set_modal_scale_in(
   set_scale_intervals( 'output'  ->  set_modal_scale_out(

 * 1.00 introduced breaking changes to modal_map, which previously did not
   really support transpositions at all. Sorry.
